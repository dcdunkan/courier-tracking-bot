  👋🏼 Hi there! I can help you to get details and new updates of your courier.

  Send me a valid tracking ID and just wait. — maximum 30 seconds. I will send you the details. I can send you updates if you enable the notification.

  You can select a method to get the details of your package.
  1. <b>Auto detection</>: Use this method if you don't know about the package carrier.
  2. <b>Choose Carrier</>: If you do know the package carrier's name, use this method to get more accurate results easily.

  /help — Shows this message.
  /trackings — Lists the tracking IDs you currently subscribed to (enabled notification) and lets you manage them.
  /about — About this bot including source code details.
  /faq - Some questions you probably gonna ask eventually.

  This bot fetches data from services like <a href="https://aftership.com">AfterShip</>, <a href="https://trackingmore.com">TrackingMore</>. The data might be inaccurate or sometimes you won't get the details even if the ID is valid. Consider retrying or dropping the attempts since it harms the server.
